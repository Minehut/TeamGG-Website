						<h2>General Composure</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Warzone's official language is English. We ask that you communicate on our platforms in said language.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ensure that you are respectful to all players and are helping to maintain our server's positive atmosphere. 
								Harassment and bullying are not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Presenting toxic behavior on our services is not allowed.
								This can be considered as acting negatively towards other players, being a bad sportsman, or behaving disrespectfully in any capacity. 
								We aim to provide all players with a safe and relaxed environment; Toxicity has no place on Warzone.
							</li>
							<li>
								Be aware that others may take offense when it comes to profanity. 
								While we're lenient when it comes to swearing, we ask that you do not direct profanity towards other players. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Using excessive capitalization in chat, flooding the chat and
								spamming the chat are all not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Discrimination of any kind is not allowed. This includes
								discrimination based on gender, race, disability, religion,
								sexual orientation, and other protected groups.
							</li>
							<li>
								Suicidal encouragement and encouraging self-harm is strictly
								forbidden.
							</li>
							<li>
								We ask that you are respectful toward members of the staff team,
								as you would be to normal players. Make sure to follow
								instructions from staff.
							</li>
							<li>
								Staff impersonation on any platform by rank, association, or name is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Any form of an advertisement on our platforms is not allowed, whether it be publicly or privately.
								This includes advertising Minecraft servers, social media, or comparing our server with another server (in favor of the other server).
							</li>
							<li>
								Evading punishments is not allowed. This includes using
								alternate accounts to join our Discord or Minecraft server when
								banned. Users who are muted in-game are not permitted to chat in
								our <span className='white'>#server-chat</span> Discord bridging
								channel.
							</li>
							<li>
								Warzone is not a marketplace. To protect our players from scams and other financial offenses, selling, soliciting, 
								and/or buying anything through our services (that is not from our official store) are not allowed. 
								By extension, scamming or defrauding other players is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li> 
								Disrupting the community by any means will not be tolerated. 
								We consider community disruption as raiding, rioting, violently protesting, or intentionally provoking any kind of disruption within our community.
								Additionally, encouraging players to violate one of Warzone's rules is highly discouraged.
							</li>
							<li>
								Revealing players' personal information will result in the termination of your access to Warzone's platforms.
								This includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, home addresses, and phone numbers. 
								Moreover, sharing confidential information related to Warzone and its services is also not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Threatening other players or the server is not allowed. This
								includes (D)DoS Threats, Dox threats, death threats and other
								threats of that nature.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>General Gameplay</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>You must have an appropriate username, skin, and cape.</li>
							<li>
								Do not attempt to harm your team. This includes game throwing
								(intentionally losing a game or not attempting to win), team
								griefing (breaking blocks under teammates, stealing from chests,
								sabotaging your team's defences, preventing your team from
								achieving objectives), and cross teaming (teaming up with a
								player of the opposite or different team).
							</li>
							<li>
								Map and statistic abuse are not allowed. This includes grinding
								alt accounts, spawn killing, leaving the game just before being
								killed, switching teams just before you lose, team stacking, block glitching and
								anything similar that may positively affect your stats above
								other players on the server are not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not abuse gameplay bugs, glitches, or exploits for your own
								advantage.
							</li>
							<li>
								The building of inappropriate structures will not be tolerated.
								This includes, but is not limited to: genitalia, swastikas,
								insults, and inappropriate signs.
							</li>
							<li>
								When encountering a player using illegal modifications, refrain from publicly hackusating the offender. 
								Instead, make sure to use our in-game reporting feature (<b>/report</b>).
								If there are no staff members in-game, you may use the <b>!staff</b> command on our Discord. 
								In the event that our moderation team is unavailable, you can gather evidence of the rule breaker and report it on our <a href="https://forums.minehut.com/forum/34-reports/">forums</a>
								
							</li>
							<li>
								Client modifications that give you an unfair advantage over
								other players are not allowed. Unofficial clients such as
								Badlion Client and Lunar Client are considered "use at your own
								risk". Purely aesthetic mods such as OptiFine, 5zig, and LabyMod
								are allowed, but minimaps with radars enabled, health
								indicators, skin blinkers, waypoints, etc; are not.
							</li>
							<li>
								Macros, autoclickers, multiple attack functions, physical
								hardware or software modifications to allow automated clicking,
								modifications of standard hardware limitations, etc. are not
								allowed. Any number of clicks beyond one click at a time is not
								allowed, which means butterfly clicking and drag clicking are
								both not allowed. Mouse debounce time should not be lower than
								10 milliseconds.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Discord</h2>
						<ol>	
							<li>
								Please keep all channels on topic. Be sure to check the pinned
								messages in each channel you use.
							</li>
							<li>
								Keep all names, pictures (including profile pictures), and
								messages appropriate. NSFW content is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								The use of voice changers and soundboards is not allowed.
								Additionally, turn on push to talk when necessary for
								consideration of other players.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Forums</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Participating in reports or appeals threads that you are not
								directly involved is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								All posts made on the forums must be posted in the correct category, depending on if you are making 
								a report or an appeal. They must remain on topic at all times. 
							</li>
							<li>
								Forging or faking evidence when appealing or submitting a report
								will result in an instant denial. A punishment may follow
								depending on the severity of the offense.
							</li>
							<li>
								When reporting a player, make sure to do so with sufficient
								evidence. Joke reports may be deleted and will likely lead to a
								ban on the forums.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<hr />
					<div>
						Please note that if you are IP banned in game or on our Discord
						server, all users associated with that IP address will also be
						banned. Additionally, these rules are subject to change at any time,
						without notice. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with
						the rules.
