						<h2>General Composure</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Use and practice common sense. If it sounds questionable or
								excessive, it's probably not allowed. Consult with one of our
								staff members for rules or behavior not listed on this page.
							</li>
							<li>
								The serverâ€™s official language is English, so we ask that you
								use English when communicating with the players on the server
								and in the community.
							</li>
							<li>
								Ensure that you are respectful to all players and are
								maintaining a calm and positive atmosphere while on our server.
								Harassment and bullying are not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Toxic behavior such as acting negatively towards others, being a
								bad sportsman, and disrespecting others is not allowed. We aim
								to provide all players with a safe and relaxed environment;
								Toxicity has no place on Warzone.
							</li>
							<li>
								Inappropriate behavior is not allowed. This includes, but is not
								limited to, linking, posting or sending NSFW content, making
								sexual comments or innuendos, and posting any other statement
								of that nature.
							</li>
							<li>
								Leaking players' personal information is not allowed. This
								includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, home addresses
								and phone numbers. Moreover, sharing confidential information
								related to Warzone and its services is also not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Be aware that others may find excessive profanity repulsive and
								disrespectful. While we're lenient when it comes to swearing, we
								ask that you do not direct profanity toward other players.
							</li>
							<li>
								Advertising and self-promoting are not allowed. This includes
								promoting Minehut servers, external Minecraft servers, YouTube
								channels, and Discord servers. Additionally, indirect
								advertising by inviting other players to come along with you or
								comparing Warzone's characteristics to another server
								to draw attention to it is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Keep in mind that Warzone is not a market. To protect
								our players from scams and other financial offenses, selling,
								soliciting, and/or buying anything through our services (that is
								not from our official store) is not allowed. By extension,
								scamming or defrauding other players is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Discrimination of any kind is not allowed. This includes
								discrimination based on gender, race, disability, religion,
								sexual orientation, and other protected groups.
							</li>
							<li>
								Suicidal encouragement and encouraging self-harm are strictly
								forbidden.
							</li>
							<li>
								Using excessive capitalization in chat, flooding the chat and
								spamming the chat are all not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Evading punishments is not allowed. This includes using
								alternate accounts to join our Discord or Minecraft server when
								banned. Users who are muted in-game are not permitted to chat in
								our <span className='white'>#server-chat</span> Discord bridging
								channel.
							</li>
							<li>
								We ask that you are respectful toward members of the staff team,
								as you would be to normal players. Make sure to follow
								instructions from staff.
							</li>
							<li>
								Encouraging other players to break rules is not allowed.
								Additionally, raiding, rioting, violently protesting or
								intentionally provoking any kind of disruption within our
								community members is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Impersonating staff members on any platform by rank,
								association, or name is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Threatening other players or the server is not allowed. This
								includes (D)DoS Threats, Dox threats, Death threats and other
								threats of that nature.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>General Gameplay</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>You must have an appropriate username, skin, and cape.</li>
							<li>
								Do not attempt to harm your team. This includes game throwing
								(intentionally losing a game or not attempting to win), team
								griefing (breaking blocks under teammates, stealing from chests,
								sabotaging your team's defences, preventing your team from
								achieving objectives), and cross teaming (teaming up with a
								player of the opposite or different team).
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not share information with players as a spectator to offer an
								advantage over other teams, otherwise known as ghosting.
							</li>
							<li>
								Map and statistic abuse are not allowed. This includes grinding
								alt accounts, spawn killing, leaving the game just before being
								killed, switching teams just before you lose, team stacking, and
								anything similar that may positively affect your stats above
								other players on the server are not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not abuse gameplay bugs, glitches, or exploits for your own
								advantage.
							</li>
							<li>
								The building of inappropriate structures will not be tolerated.
								This includes, but is not limited to: genitalia, swastikas,
								insults, and inappropriate signs.
							</li>
							<li>
								Do not publicly hackusate other players. Also, do not
								intentionally play in such a way that aims to get hackusations
								from other players. This means that intentionally looking to be
								falsely punished is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Client modifications that give you an unfair advantage over
								other players are not allowed. Unofficial clients such as
								Badlion Client and Lunar Client are considered "use at your own
								risk." Purely aesthetic mods such as OptiFine, 5zig, and LabyMod
								are allowed, but minimaps with radars enabled, health
								indicators, skin blinkers, waypoints, etc; are not.
							</li>
							<li>
								Macros, autoclickers, multiple attack functions, physical
								hardware or software modifications to allow automated clicking,
								modifications of standard hardware limitations, etc. are not
								allowed. Any number of clicks beyond one click at a time is not
								allowed, which means butterfly clicking and drag clicking are
								both not allowed. Mouse debounce time should not be lower than
								10 milliseconds.
							</li>
							<li>
								Bedrock Edition players must refrain from using unfair build
								mechanics that allow for scaffold-like bridging (otherwise known
								as Bedrock Bridging). For more information, contact a staff
								member.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Discord</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Please keep all channels on topic. Be sure to check the pinned
								messages in each channel you use.
							</li>
							<li>
								You must maintain an appropriate Discord profile. This includes,
								but is not limited to: usernames, nicknames, profile pictures or
								banners, and "About Me" contents.
							</li>
							<li>
								Using your Discord profile to advertise, link, or otherwise
								refer to competitor Minecraft or Discord servers is not allowed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Linking social media accounts in your Discord profile is allowed
								and is not considered advertising.
							</li>
							<li>
								The use of voice changers and soundboards is not allowed.
								Additionally, turn on push to talk when necessary for
								consideration of other players.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h2>Forums</h2>
						<ol>
							<li>All posts should be on topic.</li>
							<li>
								Forging or faking evidence when appealing or submitting a report
								will result in an instant denial. A punishment might follow
								depending on the severity of the offense.
							</li>
							<li>
								When reporting a player, make sure to do so with sufficient
								evidence. Joke reports may be deleted and will likely lead to a
								ban on the forums.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					<hr />
					<div>
						Please note that if you are IP banned in-game or on our Discord
						server, all users associated with that IP address will also be
						banned. Additionally, these rules are subject to change at any time,
						without notice. It is your responsibility to keep up-to-date with
						the rules.
