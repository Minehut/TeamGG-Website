# Warzone Website
This site is built using AngularJS


## To do list
1. Redo this readme
2. More info on homepage
3. Fix online players statistic
4. Leaderboard page rank sorting
5. Player searching
6. Discord link somewhere
7. Tournament page (will need a login/link system)
    - Sign ups
    - Interactive Bracket
    - Leaderboard for teams
    - Team page with stats
    - Team association shown on player profile

## Ideas
1. Incentify youtube, twitch, playmaking on Warzone
    - Highlight videos, channels somewhere on homepage or seperate page
2. Github updates live on website. Just like discord
