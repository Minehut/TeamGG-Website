<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
   <p>By using our (Warzone) service, information may be collected and/or stored in numerous ways:</p>

<hr>

<h3>Information Collection</h3>

<ol>
   <li> Any statistics, participation in matches, and other gameplay-related events are compiled to allow for profile pages and match pages.</li>
   <li> Any messages you send to the server are stored on our Discord and stored in match pages for moderation purposes.</li>
   <li> Any purchases made in our store are processed directly through 3rd party services (PayPal, Stripe and Xsolla) and not the Warzone administration. We do not store your personal card information on our services, nor do we have access to view it. Additionally, we have a right to prevent you from using our service if you chargeback on our store without notice to an administrator.</li>
   <li> Any reports and appeals made are available in Discord for moderation purposes. Moderators will respond accordingly to any reports and/or appeals you may make, and other users may have the ability to see them.</li>
   <li> Any IP address you use to connect to our server or Discord is stored privately in our database. Most bans are currently IP bans, so if you are taken off of our service, then your IP will be matched as well to prevent any logins from your current IP.</li>    
   <li> Any information you add to your Discord profile while on our service is entirely optional and is handled by Discord exclusively: we will not infringe and/or change any of your information. To see Discord's privacy policy, please <a href="https://discordapp.com/privacy">visit this page</a>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Policy Modification</h3>

<ol>
   <li> We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy with or without prior notice. It is your sole responsibility to stay updated with this page and to be responsible with any information that you may provide on our services (such as being mindful of what you send). You will always be able to see the last revision to the Privacy Policy on the given date above, and by continuing usage of Warzone services, you are complying with the current revisions of our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Contact Us</h3>
