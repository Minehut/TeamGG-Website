<h3>General Composure</h3>

<ol>
   <li> Maintain a casual and positive atmosphere at all times. Be respectful of all players. Harassment and bullying are strictly not allowed.</li><li> Be kind to other players. While we're pretty lenient when it comes to swearing, we ask that you do not use foul language directed towards other players.</li>
   <li> No advertising of any kind. This includes Minehut servers, external servers, YouTube channels, etc.</li>
   <li> This is not a market. To protect our users from scams and other financial offenses, selling, soliciting, and/or buying anything through our services is not allowed.</li>
   <li> Chat spamming/flooding is not allowed. Additionally, keep everything as appropriate as you can.</li>
   <li> Any client modifications that may give you an advantage over other users while in game is not permitted. Mods such as 5zig, Labymod, Optifine, or any other similar mod which doesn't give yourself a major advantage over others but may affect your client visually is allowed.</li>    
   <li> Be respectful to staff members. If they say something, you must listen and abide.</li>
   <li> Do not encourage other players to break rules. If a player breaks a rule in response to your directions, you will be held accountable.</li>
   <li> Do not impersonate staff members on any service, by rank, association, or username.</li>
   <li> Directed threats to players or the server are not permitted. This includes things under the scope of DDoS threats, Dox threats, death threats, or personal threats.</li>
</ol>

<h3>General Gameplay</h3>

<ol>
   <li> You must have an appropriate username and skin.</li>
   <li> Do not do anything that may harm your team. This includes game throwing (not trying to win) and team griefing, which entails but is not limited to things such as breaking blocks under your teammates, stealing from chests, blowing up your own side, or preventing them from getting an objective.</li>
   <li> Map/stats abuse such as grinding alts, spawn killing, leaving the game before getting killed, switching teams before you lose, and anything similar that may positively affect your stats above other players on the server is not allowed.</li>
   <li> Macros, autoclickers, multiple attack functions, physical hardware or software modification to allow automated clicking, changing standard mouse settings, modifications to standard hardware limitations, etc. are not permitted. Any clicks beyond one click are not permitted, meaning butterfly clicking is not allowed.</li>
</ol>

<h3>In the Discord</h3>

<ol>
   <li> Please keep all channels on topic. Be sure to read pinned messages in each channel if there are any.</li>
   <li> Use of voice changers is prohibited. Additionally, turn on push to talk when necessary for consideration of other players.</li>
   <li> All rules listed in the sections above also apply to the Discord server when communicating with others on our Discord Server.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that all bans in game and on our discord server are IP bans. This means if your sibling is banned, you will be banned too, unfortunately. Additionally, these rules are subject to change at any time, so check them regularly for updates.</p>
